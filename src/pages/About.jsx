                <p>
                  Hey there! I'm Karim Amhaz, a high school student from Lebanon
                  who loves web development. I've been coding for three years
                  now and have a real passion for writing clean, efficient code
                  that's not just functional, but a work of art.

              <div className="part">
                <h4>My work</h4>
                <p>
                  When it comes to my work, I strive for excellence. My goal is
                  to create websites that not only work well, but also look
                  great and are easy to use. I take great pride in my work and
                  am committed to delivering projects that exceed my clients'
                  expectations.

                <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                <p>
                  I'm always eager to learn and explore new things. Reading up
                  on the latest web development trends and techniques is a daily
                  habit of mine. I believe that there's always something new to
                  discover and that's what keeps me excited about what I do.
